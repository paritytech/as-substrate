 * @name UInt
 * @description
 * A generic unsigned integer codec. For Substrate all numbers are Little Endian encoded,
 * this handles the encoding and decoding of those numbers. Upon construction
 * the bitLength is provided and any additional use keeps the number to this
 * length. This extends `BN`, so all methods available on a normal `BN` object
 * is available here.
