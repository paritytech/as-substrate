/**
 * @name Compact
 * @description
 * A compact length-encoding codec wrapper. It performs the same function as Length, however
 * differs in that it uses a variable number of bytes to do the actual encoding. This is mostly
 * used by other types to add length-prefixed encoding, or in the case of wrapped types, taking
 * a number and making the compact representation thereof
